nodejs internally has a collection of dependencies that it used to execute our code.

two most important dependencies are the V8 project and the lib uv project

v8 project is a open source javascript engine created by google. The purpose of this project is to be able to execute javascript code outside of the browser

lib uv project is a c++ Open source project that gives nodejs access to the operating systems and underlying file systems, it also gives access to networking and it also handles some aspects of concurrency

with javascript code we write 100% javascript
with nodejs we write 50% js and 50% c++
with v8 we write 30% js and 70% c++
with lib uv we write 100% c++

nodejs gives us a nice interface to use to relate our javascript side of our application to the actual c++ thats running on our computer to actually interpret and execute out javascript code. basically, It provides a series of wrappers and a very unified and consistent API for us to use inside our projects eg the http module, fs, path, crypto

we don't want to get access to direct c++ code but we want to use some js function and use it inside of our code. so by making use of node, we don't have to work with all the c++ that exist inside of lub uv or v8


basically, the purpose of nodejs is to give us a nice consistent API for getting access to functionality that is implemented inside  v8 and lib uv


task 1: pick a function in Node standard library
function name: pbkdf2 function: this is a name of an algorithm that is used for hashing arbitrary data. it is a function inside of node crypto library. it is usually used to hash a password for storage inside of a database

https://github.com/nodejs/node
https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/lib/internal/crypto/pbkdf2.js

pbkdf2 is defined from something called process.binding. the process.binding is what connects the javascript world to the c++ world


https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/src/node_crypto.cc
in the src folder where c++ is being initializes, the v8 project is used to translate the nodejs values that we place inside our different programs (like a boolean, a function or an object all translate into their c++ equivalent)

lib uv is also used inside the file as well
it is used for  a lot of concurrency and processing constructs on the c++ side
