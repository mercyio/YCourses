IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

An IIFE is a javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined. the name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in his blog

it is a design pattern which is also known as Self Executing Anonymous Function that contains two major parts.
The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the javascript engine will directly interpret the function.


we would also use IIFE to create private and public variables ans methods.
